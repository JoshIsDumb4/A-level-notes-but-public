## 6.3.1 Carboxylic Acids
- Formed by oxidation of primary alcohols/aldehydes under reflux
- Formed by hydrolysis of nitriles ($\ce{CH3CN + 2H2O -> CH3COOH + NH4Cl}$)

Characteristics:
- High boiling points
- Shorter chains are water soluble
- They are weak acids which partially dissociate to form carboxylate ions.

## 6.3.2 Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
```ad-info
title: Definition
Compounds that can be hydrolysed to form carboxylic acids.

### Acyl Chlorides

- React violently with water, so must be kept dry $\rightarrow$ many reactions of acyl chlorides are described as anhydrous. 
- They are very reactive, and usually react by substituting the Cl for other groups.
- They are a useful way of making esters in a non-reversible reaction.

### Acid Anhydrides
![[Pasted image 20211203141821.png|400]]
- Named after the acid(s) they are named from, e.g. 2 ethanoic acid $\rightarrow$ ethanoic anhydride + water
- Gently heating an acid anhydride with an alcohol produces an ester with a better yield.

### Amides

- Amides behave, and are made, in a similar way to esters - they are often made from the reaction between acyl chlorides and amines/ammonia

## 6.3.3 Esterification
Esters can be made from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in a **reversible** reaction.

Esters can be made from a carboxylic acid **derivative** and an alcohol in a **non reversible** reaction.

## 6.3.4 Hydrolysis of Esters
Ester hydrolysis is the reverse of forming an ester from carboxylic acids and alcohols. 

![[Pasted image 20211203144126.png|400]]

- Conc $\ce{H2SO4}$ acts as a drying agent, resulting in a low concentration of water. This causes the position of equilibrium to shift right. 
- Dilute $\ce{H2SO4}$ acts as a source of water, so the position of equilibrium shifts left.

### Ester Alkaline Hydrolysis
- An alkali (e.g. NaOH) can be used instead of water. However, a carboxylate salt forms instead of a carboxylic acid.

## 6.3.5 Polymerisation and Polyesters 
Polyesters are made via condensation polymerisation. They can either be made from one monomer with both the OH functional group and the COOH functional group, or two different monomers.
