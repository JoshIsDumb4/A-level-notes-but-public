## 6.1.1 The Structure of Benzene
![[benzene.jpg|300]]
- Planar, cyclic hexagonal structure with molecular formula $\ce{C6H6}$
- Each carbon atom uses three of its four valence electrons to bond to 2 carbon atoms and 1 hydrogen atom. They have 1 electron in a p-orbital each, at right angles to the plane of bonded carbon and hydrogen electrons.
- Adjacent p-orbitals overlap sideways above and below the plane of the molecule to form $\pi$ bonds.
	- The $\pi$ bonds spread above and below the plane of the molecule, forming rings of delocalised electrons.
	- Lower electron density because they are spread over a larger space -> explains why they undergo electrophilic **substitution** instead of addition.

This is known as the _delocalised structure_.

### Kekule Structure
- Proposed in the late 1800s
- Fits with the molecular structure but not the other properties of benzene

Evidence against this model:
1) Benzene is known to have a planar hexagonal structure, with C-C bonds of **equal** length. Kekule's structure suggests alternating C-C and C=C bonds, which would have different bond lengths. 
2) Benzene has a less exothermic enthalpy change of hydrogenation than expected, suggesting that its bonds are more stable.
3) Benzene doesn't undergo electrophilic addition reactions - it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions.
4) Benzene doesn't decolourise bromine water at rtp

## Naming Aromatic Compounds
- As a side group, benzene is called "phenyl"
- When there is no main alkyl chain, the structure is named using benzene
- The OH group is on carbon 1, unless there is a group of higher priority, e.g. carboxyl
- When there is more than 1 OH group, the suffix -ol is used, e.g. benzene-1,2-diol

## 6.1.2 Reactions of Benzene
- Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions to produce unsaturated and aromatic products.
- As there is a lower electron density than in a C=C bond, electrophiles with full positive charges or halogen carrier catalysts are required. 

### Electrophilic Substitution Mechanism
![[benzene electrophilic substitution.jpg|400]]
1. Pair of electrons is attracted to the electrophile from the delocalised electrons in the centre. The H that was originally on the C is still bonded. 4 electrons remain in the $\pi$ system.
2. Note that there is no longer a full circle in the centre, creating a positive charge. It now doesn't have enough electrons. The horseshoe shape points in whatever direction the electrophile is at. The horseshoe mustn't extend past the two carbons which are the last ones involved in the system. 
3. To reestablish the $\pi$ ring of electrons, 2 electrons must rejoin it. Therefore the C-H bond breaks [[Module 4#^3224c5|heterolytically]]. 


### Nitration of Benzene
$\ce{C6H6 + HNO3->C6H5NO2 + H2O}$

 Production of Electrophile: 
 - $\ce{H2SO4 +HNO3->NO_2^+ +HSO4^- +H2O}$
- The $H^+$ formed at the end of the reaction reacts with the $HSO_{4}$ to reform $H_{2}SO_{4}$.
 
 Reagents and Conditions:
 - Temperature under 50c for single substitutions. 
 - Concentrated $\ce{HNO3}$ reactant
 - Concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$ catalyst

### Alkylation of Benzene
Substitution of a H in the benzene ring with an alkyl group. 

Production of Electrophile:
- The halogen carrier catalyst pulls off the halogen as $X^-$, now leaving the $R^+$. $\ce{AlCl4 +RCl -> AlCl4^- + R+}$
- The halogen carrier catalyst is regenerated by the end of the reaction by reacting with the $H^+$ released, e.g. $\ce{H+ +AlCl4^- -> AlCl3 +HCl}$

Reagents and Conditions:
- A suitable chloro- or bromoalkane (determined by the alkyl group you want to substitute in)
- A halogen carrier catalyst

### Halogenation of Benzene
Benzene + Halogen (NOT IODINE) -> Chlorobenzene/Bromobenzene + HX

Production of Electrophile: 
- The halogen carrier catalyst makes the bond in the halogen molecule break heterolytically: $\ce{AlCl3 +Cl2 -> AlCl4^- +Cl+}$
- The halogen carrier is regenerated at the end of the reaction by reacting with the H^+ released, e.g. $\ce{H+ +AlCl4^- -> AlCl3 +HCl}$

Conditions and Reagents:
- Halogen carrier catalyst - typically with the halogen that you want to substitute in ($\ce{AlCl3,FeCl3,AlBr3,FeBr3}$)
- Halogen

### Acylation of Benzene
- An acyl group is a side chain that has a C double bonded to an O, e.g. phenylethanone 
![[phenylethanone.png|100]]

Reagents and Conditions:
- [[20210913 Reactions of Benzene#Acyl Chlorides|Acyl Chloride]]
- Halogen carrier catalyst

$\ce{AlCl3 +RCOCl -> AlCl_4^- +RCO+}$

## 6.1.3 Phenol
Phenol is characterised by a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring. It can be found in many common household products and is used as an antiseptic.
![[Phenol.png|200]]

### Reactions of Phenol
- Forms phenoxide ion
- Has pH of 4
- Does not react with carbonates
- Undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. 
- Reacts at rtp without a halogen carrier catalyst

Common Reactions:
- Phenol reacts with bromine water, decolourising it and forming a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol.
- It reacts with metal hydroxides to form phenoxide salts.
- It reacts with dilute nitric acid to give a mixture of 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol (multiple substitutions don't tend to occur)

### Reason for Increased Reactivity
One of the lone pairs from the oxygen is donated to the system of delocalised electrons, increasing its electron density. This process is known as "activating" the benzene ring. It makes the ring more susceptible to electrophilic attack, as phenol is more able at polarising the incoming electrophile.

## 6.1.4 Directing Effects
Directing Effect - Groups of atoms already attached to the benzene ring direct substitutions to specific positions. 

### Activating Groups
All activating groups have features that increase the electron density of the delocalised ring. 

In activating groups, atoms attached directly to the ring may have: 
- Lone pairs of electrons that get drawn into the ring
- Electrons in sigma bonds in the same plane as the $\pi$ bonding, known as hyperconjugation (not in spec). Hyperconjugation is the reason behind carbocation stability. 

They are 2,4 and 6 directing and multiple substitutions are possible.

|Amine|-NH$_{2}$|
|Ether|-OR|
|2$^{o}$ amine|-NHR|

### Deactivating Groups
All deactivating groups have features that decrease the electron density. These groups all extend the area of delocalisation, drawing electrons **out** of the ring and **decreasing** the electron density in the ring.
