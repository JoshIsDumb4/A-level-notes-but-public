## 6.4.1 Amino Acids
- Alpha amino acids contain -COOH, -$NH_{2}$ and -H groups attached to the same central (alpha) atom, also known as a chiral carbon
- Amino acids are solids at rtp with high mps, and often exist as ions (zwitterions).

> Zwitterion - The ion formed when the amino acid loses a $H^+$ from the OH of the carboxylic acid group
> Isoelectric point - The pH where the zwitterion form exists

- When the pH is lower than the isoelectric point, all the places where $H^+$ could go are occupied.
- When the pH is higher than the isoelectric point, all the places where $H^+$ could be lost are empty.

## 6.4.2 Optical Isomerism
> Definition - The existence of 2 non-superimposable mirror images of a molecule which arises as a result of having a chiral atom in the structure
> Chiral atom - An atom attached to 4 different groups of atoms (not necessarily different functional groups).

## 6.4.3 Amines
Amines are an organic group derived from $NH_{3}$ where one or more of the hydrogens has been replaced by a carbon ring/chain. They are classified as primary, secondary or tertiary depending on how many Hs have been replaced. 

Naming Amines:
- Amines can be named with the suffix -amine and the prefix amino-, e.g. propylamine and 1-aminopropane
- When two or more groups are attached to the N, it is named as an N substituted derivative, e.g. N-methylpropylamine

### Formation of Amines
From Nitriles: $\ce{CH3CH2CN + 2H2(g) -> CH3CH2CH2NH2}$ with a nickel catalyst or reducing agent instead of hydrogen.  
From Nitrobenzenes: $\ce{C6H5NO2 -> C6H5NH2}$ with tin and hydrogen, or a reducing agent.  

#### From Haloalkanes
- Primary, secondary or tertiary (and quaternary amine salts) can be produced by heating (**not reflux**) a haloalkane with a concentrated solution of ammonia in ethanol.
- This is a two step synthesis.

```ad-info
title: Reasoning behind the reaction conditions
Not reflux -> Ammonia would escape as a gas
Not water -> Haloalkanes react with water to form alcohols. Haloalkanes are not soluble in water.
```

$\ce{RBr + NH3 -> RNH3+Br-}$  
$\ce{RNH3+Br- + NH3 <=> RNH2 + NH4+Br-}$  
- An excess of ammonia is required.  
- The steps in the reaction are essentially the same for secondary and tertiary amines, but ammonia is replaced with a primary/secondary amine.
- A mixture of products is formed (low yield)

Reactions of Amines:
- Amines act as weak bases, and are characteristically smelly.
- In aromatic amines, the N lone pair is partially delocalised into the aromatic ring, lowering the bass strength.
- There is some hydrogen bonding between primary and secondary amines
Base strength in order of weakest to strongest: aromatic -> ammonia -> primary amine -> secondary amine -> tertiary amine

## 6.4.4 Amides
- Amides are derived from carboxylic acids, with the functional group -$CONH_2$

### Formation of Amides and Polyamides
- Normally made from acyl chloride + amine/ammonia
- Polyamides are a type of condensation polymer formed similarly to esters. They can either be formed by a single monomer containing a carboxylic acid/acyl chloride function group and an amine group, or two monomers: dicarboxylic acid/diacyl chloride + diamine. 

### Hydrolysis of Amides and Polyamides
Acid Hydrolysis: Amide + HCl -> Amine salt + Carboxylic acid
Alkaline Hydrolysis: Amide + NaOH -> Amine + Carboxylate salt

Naming Amides:
- Primary amides are named with the suffix -amide.
- Secondary and tertiary amides are named by writing N to designate that the name is on the nitrogen atom, and alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom are named as substituents (e.g. N-ethyl-N-methylpropenamide)
