## 6.2.1 The C=O Bond
- Carbonyls are molecules containing the C=O bond
- Aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids and amides are all carbonyls. 
- The C=O bond is comprised of a $\pi$ bond and a $\sigma$ bond. 
- The C=O bond does not react in the same way as C=C because the bond has a permanent dipole. 

### Aldehydes and Ketones
- Small aldehydes and ketones are soluble in water because they form permanent dipole-dipole bonds. 
	- The longer the carbon chain, the less soluble they are in water. 
- They can be reduced back to alcohols in addition reactions.

## 6.2.2 Reduction of Carbonyls
Reagent: $\ce{NaBH4(aq)}$ (aqueous sodium borohydride/aqueous sodium tetrahydridoborate(III)) - represented by [H]
Conditions: Warming

- Carboxylic acids cannot be reduced
- The mechanism for this reaction is nucleophilic addition, where $H^-$ ions act as nucleophiles. 

### Nucleophilic Addition
![[nucleophilic addition.png|400]]
1. Sodium borohydride acts as a source of $H^-$ ions.
2. The $H^-$ nucleophile attacks the $\delta^+$ C in the C=O bond. 
3. The C now has 5 bonds. Half of the C=O bond breaks and a pair of electrons moves to the $\delta^-$ O. 
4. The $O^-$ uses a lone pair to form a bond with a $\delta^+$ H in a water molecule. 
5. The H now has 2 bonds. The HO bond in water breaks and a pair of electrons moves to the $\delta^-$ O. 
6. The resulting products are an alcohol and a hydroxide ion.

## 6.2.3 Testing for Carbonyls
### 2,4-DNPH (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine)
- Add 2,4-DNPH
- If a carbonyl is present, an orange precipitate forms. 	

Type of reaction: Condensation
- Shade of orange can differ depending on the carbon chain length.
- 2,4-DNPH derivatives have characteristic melting points which can be used to identify the carbonyl they were made from. The derivative must first be purified with recrystallisation before testing the melting point.

### Acidified Potassium Dichromate
- Add a few drops of acidified potassium dichromate solution in dilute sulfuric acid. 
- If an aldehyde or a primary/secondary alcohol is present, the solution will change from orange to green. 
- Do **not** use an excess of potassium dichromate. 

### Tollens' Reagent
Tollens' reagent is a mild oxidising agent used to identify the presence of aldehydes only. It cannot oxidise alcohols. 

Method: 
- Warm the test compound with ammoniacal silver nitrate solution
- If an aldehyde is present, a silver mirror forms
- If a ketone or alcohol is present, there would be no observable change. 

$\ce{Ag+ + e- -> Ag(s)}$
$\ce{CH3CH2CHO +[O] -> CH3CH2COOH}$

## 6.2.4 Hydroxynitrile Formation and Reactions
### Cyanides and Nitriles (-CN)
- When the cyanide group (-C$\equiv$N) is found in an organic molecule, it is called a nitrile group.
- Cyanide ions (:CN$^-$) are used in the synthesis of nitriles. They are powerful nucleophiles and react with aldehydes/ketones to form hydroxynitriles (-OH and -CN groups bonded to the same carbon atom). 
- HCN is highly toxic, so is generated in situ by reacting a cyanide with $H_{2}SO_{4}$ to improve safety and rate of reaction.

Nitriles: 
- Prepared by the reflux of a haloalkane with a cyanide salt with ethanol. 
$\ce{CH3CH2Cl + NaCN -> CH3CH2CN + NaCl}$
This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. 

Ethanol is used because it is a polar solvent. Water cannot be used because the OH- ions could act as nucleophiles.

Nitriles as Intermediates:
$\ce{RCN + 2H2 -> RCH2NH2}$ with nickel catalyst
$\ce{RCN + 2H2O + HCl -> RCOOH + NH4Cl}$ under reflux
