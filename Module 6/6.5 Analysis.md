## 6.5.1 Chromatography
Chromatography is a technique for separating a mixture into its components.The results may be used for purification, identification and percentage analysis.

| Technique                 | Stationary Phase | Mobile Phase      | Better adsorption    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Thin Layer Chromatography | silica plate     | solvent           | Substance moves less |
| Gas Chromatography        | inert solid      | inert carrier gas | Substance moves less | 

### Separating Mechanisms
Solid:
If the stationary phase is a solid, the substances separate by adsorption. Substances either adsorb onto the solid surface or are carried by the carrier gas or mobile phase. The more attracted a substance is to the solid stationary phase, the more slowly it moves down the column and the longer the retention time is

Liquid:
If the stationary phase is a liquid, a different mechanism operates. Substances either dissolve in the liquid or are carried by the carrier gas mobile phase. The more soluble a substance is in the liquid stationary phase, the more slowly it moves down the column and the longer the retention time.

### Thin Layer Chromatography
Substances a**d**sorb to the surface. The stronger the adsorption, the less they move up the plate.

title: Calculating the Rf value
$R_{f}=\frac{\text{distance moved by substance}}{\text{distance moved by solvent front}}$
```
Rf values can be used to identify substances:
- Provided conditions are always identical, a given substance always has the same Rf value when run in the same solvent.
- The Rf value depends on the polarity of the substance; substances separate according to relative polarity and how strongly they adsorb onto the stationary phase.

### Gas Chromatography
Retention time - The amount of time it takes for a substance to move through the equipment.

- The integration peaks show the relative proportions or percentages of each component.
- Very small amounts of substance are required (picograms)
- Separates things better than TLC
- Can detect compounds in trace amounts

## 6.5.2 Testing for Functional Groups
| Functional Group       | Chemical test                                                     | Observation                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Phenol                 | Bromine water                                                     | Brown -> colourless, white ppt forms               | 
| Alkene                 | Bromine water                                                     | Decolourises from orange to colourless             |
| Haloalkane             | Add aqueous silver nitrate and ethanol, warm to 50c in water bath | Chloride (white), bromide (cream), iodide (yellow) |
| Carbonyl               | 2,4-DNPH                                                          | Orange solution, orange/red ppt forms.             |
| Aldehyde               | Tollens reagent and warm                                          | Colourless solution -> silver mirror               |
| 1R-OH, 2R-OH, aldehyde | Acidified potassium dichromate (VI) and warm                      | Orange -> green                                    |
| Carboxylic acid        | Aqueous sodium carbonate                                          | Effervescence                                      |

## 6.5.3 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Equivalence - Atoms in exactly the same position in a molecule are said to be equivalent to each other (same environment).

- Used to detect and differentiate C atoms in organic molecules by detecting 13C isotopes
- TMS (tetramethylsilane) acts as a reference, creating a peak at 0ppm.

## 6.5.4 Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Proton NMR shows:
- The number of different chemical environments in the compound
- The relative number of hydrogen ions in each environment
- The electron density around the hydrogen atoms
- How many neighbouring hydrogen atoms each hydrogen has

Integration Traces:
The integration trace is a continuous dashed line that runs along the spectrum. The y value increases whenever there is a signal. The height of the step increase is proportional to the area under the signal.

NMR solvents:
Regular solvents can't be used because they produce a signal. Therefore deuterated solvents such as $\ce{CDCl3}$ are used. (D is deutrium).

n+1 rule - a signal will be split if it has adjacent protons that are not in the same chemical environment. Signals will be split into one more peak than there are adjacent protons. (Protons on benzene rings are often in multiple environments and can produce complicated signals)
