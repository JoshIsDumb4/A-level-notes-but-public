## Development of Amplifiers
- Amplifier has more effect on sound than guitar pickups
- Early amplifiers used tubes/valves, and these were used almost exclusively until the late 60s/early 70s
- Transistors were invented in the 1940s and were used to replace vacuum tubes/valves
	- Made out of semi-conductive materials, e.g. germanium, silicon

| Valve Amps| Transistor Amps|
|---|---|
|Better harmonics| Worse distortion (even order harmonics)|
|Smaller and cheaper| Must pre-heat|
| More reliable| Can break easily, fragile|

## Effects
- Invented in the 1950s after Marty Robbins recorded "Don't Worry" on a broken mixing desk and liked the sound
- Sound replicated by an engineer who created the first fuzz pedal (1960s)
- As circuits became more complex, a wider range of sounds became available


### Boost/Overdrive/Distortion:
- Works by amplifying signal
- Overdrive and distortion boost past maximum headroom, cutting the top of the wave off
- Done with transistors or vacuum tubes


### Delay and Reverb:
- Delay plays back the signal after a defined amount of time and blends it with the dry signal

|Type of Delay| How it works|
|---|---|
|Early Delay| Tape Loops| 
|Digital Delay| Delays sample then plays back signal|
|Analogue Delay| Bucket brigade circuits|
- Reverb uses multiple delays to create room sounds


### Wah
- Band pass filter on a foot rocker
- Player's foot controls the central frequency of the filter
- Has fixed bandwidth and gain
