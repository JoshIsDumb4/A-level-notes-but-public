## History and Development:
- Acoustic guitars have existed for hundreds of years, with roots going back to lutes and arabic fretted instruments.
	- Originally had strings of cat gut

The Modern Guuitar:
- In the 20th century, musicians switched to using steel strings, coinciding with the developement of jazz.
- In the 1930s, musicians experimented with placing pickups to archtop guitars to connect their instruments to amplifiers. 
	- Had feedback at high volume due to the guitar being hollow. 

Leo Fender:
- Electronics engineer who originally ran a radio repair shop in the 1940s
- Started to fix and design basic amps
- Invented the stratocaster in 1954, which featured 3 single coil pickups, floating bridge and whammy bar/tremolo.

Les Paul:
- Les Paul invented the log (a pickup on a solid lump of wood) in early 1940s to avoid feedback from hollow guitar
- Gibson worked with Les Paul to invent the Les Paul in 1953.
- 1957 - Les Paul updated to contain a humbucker pickup, which was less susceptible to noise

1960s Onwards:
- Exploration of other body shapes, such as the SG, flying V and jaguar.
- The technology has improved but the essentials are the same. 

Bass Guitar:
- Invented because upright/double basses were not loud enough
- Pickups were originally fitted to double basses
- 1951 Fender Precision Bass

## How Electric Guitars Work:
-   Current induced in pickups (magnetic induction)
-   String vibrates within magnetic field of the pickup, inducing current.
-   Signal is fed to amplifier
-   Controlled by volume and tone pickups
-   Single coil pickups are susceptible to noise
-   Humbucker is essentially two single coil pickups next to each other, but one is flipped so that the signal is picked up inversely. This means that the noise is picked up evenly on both. When it is flipped back, the noise is cancelled out (phase cancellation). Balanced signal.
