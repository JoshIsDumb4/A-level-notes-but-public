## Early Electronic Instruments
- Concept developed by Elisha Gray in 1876, and was developed from similar concepts as telephony

Theremin (1920):
- Invented by Leon Theramin as a byproduct of research into proximity sensors
- Pitch and volume is controlled by changing proximity of hands to the instrument

Ondes Martenot (1928):
- Dual interface (standard piano keyboard and string to glide between notes, vibrato, etc)
- Used by composers (e.g. Massiaen) and modern arists (e.g. Jonny Greenwood - Radiohead)

Trautonium: 
- Wire is pressed onto metal plate to create pitches
- Different models created for bass, alto, etc

Not true synthesis because they are not creating sound from waveforms.

## Early Synthesis (1930s-40s)
- All the elements for synthesis had been invented (oscillators, filters, etc).
	- Synths were reliant on valves/vacuum tubes and were large
- Basic synthesis was incorporated into electronic instruments to recreate traditional sounds e.g. strings
- Synths were used for experimental music, e.g. musique concrete and electroacoustic music

## Modular Synths (1960s)
- Used transistor technology
- Moog popularised Control Voltage (CV)
- Used by popular musicians and classical composers
- Customisable with interchangable parts. 
- High cost

## Minimoog (1970)
- Smaller, suitcase sized instrument
- Fixed synthesis architecture to appeal to the wider market
- Cheaper

## Polyphonic Synthesisers
- Originally created in 1930s, but only experimentally
- Requires multiple synced oscillators to stay in tune
- Early polyphonic synths include: Polyphonic and Ob-X (Oberheim, 1975), CS-80 (Yamaha (1975)

### Prophet 5 (1978)
- Introduced microprocessors in its design, allowing it to store presets
- Integration of digital tech into synths - analogue sound controlled digitally

## FM and Digital Synthesis
- Yamaha licenced Frequency Modulation synthesis in 1970 from its inventor, John Chowning
- FM synth launched in 1980
- DX-7 (1983) was the first synth to use MIDI. 

## Digital Technology and Modern Development
- 1970s/80s - digital synths and samplers were becoming increasingly popular, used in pop (e.g. Fairlight CMI)
- By the 1980s and 90s, most synths were digital. 
- Dance music popularised synths 
- DAWs emulate synths with modelling
- Companies such as Moog still create analogue synths.
