Development of Jazz:
-   Originated in around 1900 in the US
-   Developed from a combination of slave work songs and Western Classical Art music
-   Developed by a "new" black middle class â€“ rich, educated and familiar with western music but African rhythms
-   This led to ragtime.
-   Ragtime is a written out form of music -> none of it is improvised
-   It is very syncopated
-   Features "stride" accompaniment (octave bass notes, jumping to a chord higher up and back and forth)

Instrumentation:
-   Tuba, banjo or guitar play the stride pattern between bass notes and chords
-   Melody is played by trumpet/clarinet and often play contrapuntal stuff

Dixieland:
-   Developed from ragtime
-   Features highly syncopated, very melodic polyphonic lines
-   Maintains the stride feel amongst the instruments
-   1910s-1930s

Early Swing:
-   Developed from Dixieland by incorporating more swung rhythms
-   Fewer polyphonic melody instruments
-   Introduction of improvisation
-   Rhythm section began to play less stride style parts

Swing:
-   Big band era (1940s)
