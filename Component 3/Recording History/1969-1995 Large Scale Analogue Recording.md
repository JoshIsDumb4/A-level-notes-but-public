## Timeline
1963 - Cassette tape invented by Philips. Quickly became standard
1966 - Recording limited to 4 tracks, releases tended to be mono still
1967 - 12 track recording (Scully), 16 track MM-1000 with 2 inch tape, first prototype 16-track studio recorder (Ampex)
1968 - 24 track recording (MCI - Sony)
1971 - At least 21 studios in London were using 16 track recording and Dolby noise reduction
1979 - TASCAM Portastudio used compact audio cassette for affordable 4 and 8 track recording (reel-to-tape tech)
70s/80s - 24 tracks became the most common format in professional recording
1980s - Digital multitrack machines began to appear in professional studios

## Other key points:
- Ability to edit, overdub -> songs did not have to be finished before entering the studio.
- Bouncing down, synchronisation of machines to create one massive project.
- 2 inch tape was used instead of 1/4 inch tape, allowing for more tracks to be played at once and more tracks to be recorded on a single tape.
- Bigger machines allowed musicians and producers the ability to experiment with more instruments and more microphones.
- les paul created sound on sound recording by modifying tape deck (device could nullify the erase function of tape recorders). Each additional pass on the tape introduced more noise, e.g. distortion 
- Companies such as SSL and Neve specialised in large mixing desks. They were fitted with distinctive sounding preamps and EQ sections and have been used on countless recordings

## ADT 1966 (Automatic/Artificial Double Tracking):
- Created by EMI technical engineer Ken Townsend for The Beatles to avoid them having to rerecord vocals to create vocal overdubs
- Used throughout the late 60s and 70s until the arrival of digital technology

## Factors that affect the sound of a tape machine/recording:
- Tape speed (signal to noise ratio)
- Wow and flutter (what are these?)
- angle of tape
- tape tension
- condition of the heads

## Original Ampex model:
- 8 tracks
- 2.1m tall, weighed 110kg
- 1.8mm tracks with 1.5mm guard track, 25mm tape
- Was known as the octopus
