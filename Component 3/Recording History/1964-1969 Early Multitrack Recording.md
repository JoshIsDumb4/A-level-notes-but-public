-   By the early 1960s, multitrack machines were becoming more common in professional studios
-   These had 3-4 tracks that could be recorded simultaneously
-   This had the advantage that a part can be rerecorded without having to rerecord the entire thing (dropping in and dropping out)
-   More tracks allowed more musically ambitious recording
-   Multiple guitar parts, keyboard parts and orchestral instruments into pop music

Reduction Mixing:
-   More musically ambitious things needed more tracks than what was physically possible at the time
-   Engineers would bounce down multiple tracks onto one new track on a different tape machine
-   To do this, two tape machines had to be synchronised so that the speed would not change
-   By the end of the 1960s, 8 track and 16 track machines were becoming more readily available in professional studios, reducing the need for reduction mixing
