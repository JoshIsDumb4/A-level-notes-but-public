-   Developed from early audio and MIDI manipulation software
-   Originally limited by processing power and was not affordable
-   Over time, software gradually began to incorporate studio hardware, e.g. Dynamics processing

-   Technology has become smaller, cheaper and more accessible - it has changed the way we record music
-   Theoretically anyone can now access studio equipment and release their music
-   Producers and musicians now have access to almost infinite numbers of tracks and limitless recording time
-   This encourages people to be more experimental
-   Overdubs can be repeated multiple times until correct
-   Musicians can play all the parts at home themselves without the need for other musicians
-   DAWs are currently evolving
