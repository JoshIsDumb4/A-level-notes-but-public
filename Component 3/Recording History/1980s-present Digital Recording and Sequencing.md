  Digital Recording and Sequencing:
-   By the 1980s, studios began to incorporate digital technology in their setups
-   Digital tape began to be used as an alternative to analogue tape
-   Digital tape was a lot better quality than analogue tape
-   Information is stored as binary
-   Digital tape is different from analogue in the way it stores the audio information written to it
	-   Analogue tape captures audio as continuous pieces of information via the record head
	-   Digital tape converts the incoming audio signal into binary

Analogue to digital converters:
-   Digital tape machines had to contain converters to change the incoming analogue signal into digital data
-   Analogue to digital converters (ADC) are still used in equipment today
-   The first entirely digital album was Dire Straits, Brothers in Arms
-   Moore's law states that every 18 months to two years, technology will either halve in size, double in power or halve in price
-   Hard disk audio recorders developed as an alternative to digital tape machines.

Sequencing:
-   Early sequencers were hardware devices that were used to control electronic instruments
-   They would send out Control Voltage (CV) data to trigger time and pitch information.
-   In 1981, Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits proposed a language to all major electronic instrument manufacturers
-   In 1983, a new major protocol was launched: MIDI
-   The invention of MIDI meant that any two pieces of electronic musical equipment could control each other
-   It was a digital signal rather than the analogue signal
-   Although MIDI was tricky to control with hardware, computer manufacturers embraced the protocol
-   They started to build graphical interfaces, which led to the computer based sequencer and later the DAW
-   Many DAWs started off as MIDI sequencers on the Atari, and once they integrated audio, It's a DAW
-   By the late 1990s, DAWs were the main platform for recording and sequencing
-   This reduced the need for hardware, digital recorders and hardware sequencers

Advantages:
-   Better quality recordings
-   Cheaper
-   MIDI is universal

Disadvantages:
-   Recording may be less accurate depending on bitrate
-   Some people prefer vinyl
-   Control voltage is not universal
