## Tape Delay
- Sound is recorded on a piece on tape, which then is played back after the amount of time it takes for the tape to loop. 
- Tape is constantly being overwritten. 
- Invented by Les Paul

## Analogue Delay

```
- Each time the signal passes through a capacitor in the BBD circuit, there is a small loss of quality, losing volume and treble/bass.

## Digital Delay
- Signal is converted to digital w/ADC, then stored and delayed before converted back to analogue w/DAC
- Created in the mid 80s

## Flanger
- Modulation effect (modulation of delay)
- Signal is delayed, then the length of the delay is altered (comb filtering)
- Characteristic whooshing, metallic sound

## Chorus
- Modulation of delay pitch
- Pitch variance controlled by LFO
- Gives impression of several instruments playing the same part with micro-variances in pitch

## Reverb
- Emulation of reflections of sound in a room
- Each signal is a tiny delay with some degradation of volume and quality
