## 3.3.1 Introduction to Rates of Reaction
[[Module 3#3 3 1 Introduction to Rates of Reaction|Definitions]]  
_The change in concentration of a reactant or a product in a given time_  
$rate\ (moldm^{-3}s^{-1})=\frac{\Delta concetration}{time}$  

Collision Theory:  
Particles must collide in the correct orientation and with sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy for a reaction to occur. In order to increase the rate of reaction, the number of collisions with sufficient energy per unit time must be increased. This can be done in the following ways: 
1) Increasing the frequency of collisions. 
2) Increasing the proportion of particles with energy greater than the activation energy. 
3) Changing the route (mechanism/reaction pathway) that the reaction takes.

The effects of concentration of reactant, temperature, pressure (of gases) and surface area (of solid reactants) on the rate of the reaction can all be explained by collision theory. 

Rate and Energy - Boltzmann Distribution:  
![[Boltzmann distribution.png|400]]  
- At a set temperature, different particles have different amounts of kinetic energy.
- A Boltzmann distribution shows spread of kinetic energy among a set of particles at a given temperature.
- There are no particles with no energy.
- Area under curve = total number of particles.
- The graph must start at (0,0) and must never touch the x axis afterwards.
- Collisions are assumed to be elastic with no energy lost.
- In many reactions, the number of particles with sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy is very small.
- Higher temperature increases the proportion of particles that have sufficient energy to react. 

Catalysts:  
Catalyst - A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being used up in the process. 
- It is estimated that 90% of all chemical processes use a catalyst.
- Catalysts lower the activation energy

Advantages of Catalysts: 
- Speeds up industrial processes
- Improves atom economy and percentage yields 
- Saves energy, resources and costs
- Reduces emissions and waste

## 3.3.2 Measuring the Rate of Reaction
- To analyse the rate of reaction, the concentration of a reactant or product during the course of a reaction must be monitored. From this, a graph of concentration vs time can be plotted.
- Often, it is difficult to directly measure concentration, so other quantities are measured such as: volume of gas, colour, pressure, transparency, mass and conductivity. 

Volume: 
- Suitable if gas is formed.
- Can be measured with gas syringe or upturned measuring cylinder.
- Volume collected is noted down at various time intervals.

Mass loss: 
- Suitable if gas is formed unless gas is hydrogen or water soluble.
- Reaction is carried out on a balance.
- Mass is noted at various time intervals. 

Colour Change: 
- Suitable if there is a colour change/precipitation formed during a reaction.
- Reaction is carried out in a colorimeter and absorbance is noted down at regular time intervals.
- When using a colorimeter, a filter that is complementary to the color being detected must be used. 

Conductivity: 
- Suitable if there is a difference in net charge in the form of ions between the two sides of the equation.
- Conductivity probe is immersed in the reaction mixture and conductivity value is noted down at various time intervals.

Why pH is unsuitable: 
- pH is a logarithmic scale, which means that a pH change of unit 1 would mean a change of 10x in acidity/alkalinity.
- Most of the reaction would have finished before any specific pH change would be visible.

Clock Reactions: 
- A fixed amount of extra reactant (thiosulfate) is added to allow the reaction to be monitored like a clock  ($H_{2}O_{2(aq)}+2I^{-}_{(aq)}\rightarrow I_{2(aq)}+2H_{2}O_{(l)}$)
- Once the reaction begins, the additional thiosulfate reacts away any iodine produced, forming a colourless solution.   ($2S_{2}O_{3(aq)}^{2-}+I_{2(aq)}\rightarrow S_{4}O_{6(aq)}^{2-}+2I^{-}_{(aq)}$)
- When the thiosulfate runs out, the iodine starts to build up in solution. It turns a starch indicator black.
- The reaction must be set up very carefully to ensure the correct amount of iodine is produced.

Flaws with Clock Reactions: 
- 1/time is not the same as the initial rate - It gives the average rate over time instead of the actual rate
- If a reaction is allowed to progress for a long time before the clock is triggered, the approximation will be poor.

## 3.3.3 The Arrhenius Equation
Rate Equation:  
$rate=k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}$  
k = rate constant  
[A] = Concentration of reactant A  
[B] = Concentration of reactant B  
m = order of reactant A  
n = order of reactant B  

Arrhenius Equation: $k=Ae^{-\frac{Ea}{RT}}$  
$ln k =\frac{-Ea}{RT}+ln A$  
$ln k = \frac{-Ea}{R}(\frac{1}{T})+ln A$  
$lnA=lnk-gradient\times\frac{1}{T}$
