## 3.1.1 Group II - The Alkaline Earth Metals
Reaction with Oxygen: 2M$_{(s)}$ + O$_{2(g)}$ → 2MO$_{(s)}$  
Reaction with Water: M$_{(s)}$ + 2H$_{2}$O$_{(l)}$ → M(OH)$_{2(aq)}$ + H$_{2(g)}$  
Reaction with acids: M$_{(s)}$ + H$_{2}$SO$_{4(aq)}$ → MSO$_{4(aq)}$ + H$_{2(g)}$  

Trends down the group: 
- Reactivity increases. 
- Solubility of metal hydroxides increases.
- pH of metal hydroxides increases. 
- Ionisation energy decreases. 

More reactions with acids:   
M$_{(s)}$ + HCl$_{(aq)}$ → MCl$_{2(aq)}$ + H$_{2(g)}$  
M$_{(s)}$ + 2HNO$_{3(aq)}$ → M(NO$_{3}$)$_{2(aq)}$ + H$_{2(g)}$ 

Observations when reacting with excess acid: 
1) Grey solid added to colourless liquid. 
2) Effervescence occurs. 
3) Solid dissolves to leave a colourless solution. 

Reactions of Group II Metal Oxides: 
- They are bases and all are (at least partially) soluble in water (alkalis)
- When a metal oxide is dissolved in water, O$^{ 2−}_{ (aq)}$ ions are formed.
- The O$^{ 2−}_{ (aq)}$ ions immediately react with water to form OH$^− _{(aq)}$ ions. 
- This means that they are alkalis. 
- Solubility increases down the group → greater concentration of OH$^− _{(aq)}$ ions → higher alkalinity and pH.

## 3.1.2 Group VII - The Halogens
At RTP:  
F$_{2(g)}$ - Pale yellow gas  
Cl$_{2(g)}$ - Pale green gas  
Br$_{2(l)}$ - Orange liquid (forms orange vapour)  
I$_{2(s)}$ - Grey-black solid (sublimes to purple vapour)

Boiling/Melting Points: 
- BP/MP increases down the group. 
Reasoning: 
- Structure - Simple molecular 
- Bonds which need to be broken - IMFs (London Forces)  
The number of electrons increases down the group, so the strength of the London forces also increases. The London forces therefore require more energy to break, so melting and boiling points increase. 

.
- Halogens are oxidising agents. They tend to gain an electron to form a 1− ion. 

Reactivity: 
- The reactivity of the halogens decreases down the group. 
-     This is because although the nuclear charge of the halogen atoms increases, the atomic radius and the amount of shielding also increases. Therefore overall, there is a smaller attraction on the electron being gained. This means that it is more difficult for the atom to gain and electron and be reduced. 

Displacement reactions of the halogens: 
- Can be used to illustrate the differences in reactivity.
- Halogen displacement is a redox reaction which occurs when a more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halogen from a compound. E.g. $\ce{Cl2(aq) + 2Br− (aq) → 2Cl− (aq) + Br2(aq)}$
- In the halogen displacement reaction series, a halogen solution is added to a halide ion solution of another halogen.
- If a reaction occurs, there will be a colour change.
- Hexane is often added to help identify the halogen present and will form a layer above the water layer.
- More reactive halogens will displace less reactive halogens because a halogen atom atom higher up the group has a smaller atomic radius and less shielding. It therefore has a greater attraction for an electron and is better able to act as an oxidising agent and can be reduced.

## 3.1.3 Reactions of Chlorine
[[Module 3#3 1 The Periodic Table|Definitions]]  
$Cl_{2(aq)}+H_{2}O_{(l)}\rightarrow HClO_{(aq)}+HCl_{(aq)}$
- Some of the chlorine is oxidised and some of it is reduced. 
- A redox reaction where the same element is both oxidised and reduced is known as a disproportionation reaction. 

Bleach: 
- Bleach is a common name for a solution containing chlorate(I) ions (ClO$^−$). 
- HClO isn’t useful as a household bleach, as chlorine isn’t very soluble in water. Therefore household bleach is made by bubbling chlorine through cold aqueous sodium hydroxide.
$Cl_{2(aq)}+2NaOH_{(aq)}\rightarrow NaClO_{(aq)}+NaCl_{(aq)}+H_{2}O_{(l)}$

## 3.1.4 Risk Assessments
Purpose - Identification of all the ways in which materials or procedures may result in harm, the potential seriousness of that harm and the measures which might be put into place to reduce the potential seriousness/likelihood of that harm occurring. 

It must: 
- Be carried out before a practical. 
- Take all chemicals (reactant, product, indicator, catalyst) into consideration. 
- Take procedure and equipment into account. 

Steps: 
1) Identify all the chemicals you are likely to come into contact with (write equation). Include reactants, products, catalysts, indicators and solvents. 
2) Use datasheet to identify hazards. 
3) Identify risks and try to reduce them. 
4) Identify risks in practical procedure and try to reduce those too. 

Hazards: 
- Each chemical material falls into one or more hazard categories.
- The hazard of a material represents the potential of the material to cause harm. It also suggests the type of harm. 
- The hazard of a material depends on its physical state, as well as concentration (if applicable). 

Risk: 
- Depends on hazard of material, the amount of substance used and what is done with it. 
- Control measures can be used to reduce risk.
