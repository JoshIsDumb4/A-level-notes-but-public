## 3.2 Enthalpy Changes
[[Module 3#3 2 Enthalpy Changes|Definitions]]  
Enthalpy is not a useful measure as it can’t be measured. Therefore enthalpy change is used instead. 

Exothermic - Enthalpy of reactants is higher than the products, energy is released into the surroundings. −∆H.  
Endothermic - Enthalpy of reactants is lower than the products, energy is taken in from the surroundings. +∆H  
- Making bonds is exothermic.
- Breaking bonds is endothermic.
- Exothermic and endothermic refer to the system (reactants + products). Everything else is the surroundings. 

Activation energy, the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to take place, is required to break bonds in the reactants. 

- The higher the specific heat capacity of a substance, the more energy is can store without changing state. 
- Water has a very high specific heat capacity due to hydrogen bonds. 
Q = mc∆T 

Calorimetry: 
- Used to measure heat energy exchanged during chemical reactions.
-  In a lab, it is achieved by measuring the heat transferred between a chemical reaction and a sample of water. 

## 3.2.1 Standard Enthalpy Changes 
[[Module 3#3 2 1 Standard Enthalpy Changes|Definitions]]  
Standard Conditions: Temp: 298K
Pressure: 1atm
Solutions: 1moldm$^{−3}$ 

- Used because enthalpy change may vary due to conditions.
- Symbol is ∆$_{x}H^{◦}$.

## 3.2.2 Bond Enthalpy
[[Module 3#3 2 2 Bond Enthalpy|Definitions]]  
Def - The average enthalpy change when one mole of a particular type of bond is broken homolytically in the gaseous phase. 

Calculations: 
- Form a table/list of all bonds formed and broken.
- Used to calculate the ∆H of a reaction.
- Designed to be quick and easy, but may not be accurate because the values are averages and taken in the gas phase. They also do not take into account the reaction environment. 
- bonds formed - bonds broken

## 3.2.3 Hess Cycles
[[Module 3#3 2 3 Hess Cycles|Definitions]]
- Used to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction by using standard enthalpy changes of other reactions of the reactants and products. 

```Hess’ Law - The enthalpy change for any chemical reaction is independant of the intermediate stages, so long as the initial and final conditions are the same for each route.```
