| Rate of Reaction      | The change in concentration of a reactant (or product) in a given time.                                                                         |
| Mechanism             | a sequence of steps by which reactants are converted to products, where each step is a single successful collision between 2 particles. ^d92be6 |
| Rate determining step | The slowest step in a reaction mechanism                                                                                                        |

| Le Chatelier's Principle | When a system is in dynamic equilibrium is subjected to a change, the reaction will shift to minimise the change. |
| Partial Pressure         | The contribution made by a gas towards the total pressure in a system                                             |
