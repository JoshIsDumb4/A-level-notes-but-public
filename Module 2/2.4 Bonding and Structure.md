## 2.4.1 Bonding 
[[Module 2#2 4 1 Bonding|Definitions]]  
Ionic Bonding: 
- Ionic bond - An electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. 
- Formed between positive metal cations and negative non-metal anions. 
![[IONIC.jpg|350]]

Covalent Bonding: 
- Covalent bond - The strong electrostatic attraction between a shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the bonded atoms.
- Normally formed between non-metal atoms. 

Metallic Bonding: 
- Metallic bond - The electrostatic attraction between positive metal ions and delocalised electrons. 

Drawings must show: 
- A regular lattice (min 3x3) of metal cations with gaps inbetween, labelled with charge. 
-  Delocalised electrons between the cations.
- Labels (”lattice of positive [...] cations” and ”delocalised electrons”. 

Lone pairs: 
- Lone pair - A pair of electrons that are not involved in bonding
- Must always be shown in dot and cross diagrams.
- Can sometimes be used to form a [[Module 2#2 4 Bonding and Structure|dative covalent bond]]. 
- Represented by an arrow. 

Octet rule - For elements in group 4-7, there is one bond for each outer shell electron less than 8. 
- Some atoms are able to have more or less than 8 valence (outer shell electrons). S can have 10 or 12, P can have 10, Be can have 4, B and Al can have 6.

Giant Covalent Lattice:  
Definition - A 3 dimensional structure of atoms held together by the electrostatic attractions between pairs of shared electrons and the nuclei of the bonded atoms. 
- Held together by strong covalent bonds between atoms. 

Simple Molecular Structure:

- Most covalent molecules exist as a simple molecular structure.
- The atoms within molecules are held together by covalent bonds.
- Molecules are attracted other molecules by intermolecular forces.

## 2.4.3 Key Properties
Melting Point: (also applies to boiling point) 
- In order to melt a solid, the forces of attraction within the solid structure must be broken, leaving behind separated particles.
- The energy required to melt a substance depends on the strength of the forces between the particles. 
- Stronger force → more energy required → higher melting point 

Electrical Conductivity: 
- In order to conduct electricity, a substance must contain charged particles which are able to move around. These are sometimes known as mobile charge conductors. 
-     ”Carrying charge” $\neq$ moving charge around. It just means that something is positive or negatively charged. A charge carrier isn't necessarily an electron. 
- If they are able to move around (delocalised/bonds broken) then a substance can conduct electricity. 
- Strength of an ionic bond depends on the ionic charge and the ionic radius.
- Strength of a metallic bond depends on the ionic charge and the ionic radius of the metal cations, and the number of delocalised electrons per cation.

## 2.4.4 VSEPR Theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) 
- Molecules have 3 dimensional shapes. 
- Valence electrons in bonding pairs and lone pairs repels each other as far apart as possible (largest possible angle).
- Lone pairs repel slightly more than bonding pairs.
- Different molecules have different shapes due to different numbers of bonding pairs in the valence shell of the central atom.
- The number of bonding pairs and lone pairs determines the shape.
- The greater the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs, the smaller the bond angle. 

Shapes of Molecules:
![[2D Molecule shapes.png]]
- 3D shapes must be drawn as projections. 

Linear: 
- 2 bonding pairs of electrons, no lone pairs. 
- Bond angle around central atom is 180◦ 

Trigonal Planar: 
- 3 bonding pairs of electrons, no lone pairs. 
- Bond angle around central atom is 120◦ 

Tetrahedral: 
- 4 bonding pairs of electrons and no lone pairs. 
- Bond angle around central atom is 109.5◦ 

Octahedral: 
- 6 bonding pairs of electrons and no lone pairs. 
- Bond angle around central atom is 90◦ 

Trigonal Pyramid: 
- 3 bonding pairs of electrons and 1 lone pair. 
- Bond angle around central atom is 107◦ 
- Electrons repel to a tetrahedral arrangement but the lone pair can’t be seen. 

Non Linear: 
- 2 bonding pairs of electrons and 2 lone pairs.
- Bond angle around central atom is 104.5◦ 

Multiple bonds: 
- Multiple bonds count as single bonds when writing out the shape of a molecule. 
- They have an effect on the number of lone pairs.

## 2.4.5 Bond types
[[Module 2#2 4 5 Bond Types|Definitions]]  
Non-polar covalent bonds: 
- Little or no difference in electronegativity. (Except C-H) 
- Two nuclei attract the electrons with a roughly equal force. 

Polar covalent bonds: 
- Polar covalent bonds form when one of the bonded nuclei has a greater electrostatic attraction for the bonded electrons than the other.
- One of the nuclei attracts the electrons more strongly than the other, the electrons in the bond are still shared but unequally.
- Small difference in electronegativity. (0 < x < 1.8) 

Ionic bonds: 
- A large difference in electronegativity. (> 1.8) 
- The difference in the strength of attraction of the nuclei is great enough for the stronger nuclei to take the electrons itself. 

Electronegativity:  
![[Electronegativity.png|400]]  
Definition - A measure of the attraction of a bonded atom for the pair of electrons in a covalent bond. 
- Measured with the Pauling Scale. 
- Elements get more electronegative towards the top right of the periodic table (ignoring noble gases). 
- To find out if a bond is polar, find the difference in Pauling values. 

Labelling polar bonds: 
- Must look at each bond in a molecule individually. 
- δ$^-$ = higher pauling value, more electronegative δ$^+$ = lower pauling value, less electronegative 

Criteria for a molecule to be polar: 
1) Molecule must contain polar bonds. 
2) Molecule must be asymmetric. i.e. the central atom is not entirely surrounded by atoms of equal electronegativity and/or it has lone pairs.

## 2.4.6 Intermolecular Forces (IMFs) 
[[Module 2#2 4 6 Intermolecular Forces IMFs|Definitions]]  
Definition - The weak attractions between different molecules which are broken when simple molecular substances are melted/boiled. 

Strength from lowest to highest:   
London forces (induced dipole-dipole interactions) → permanent dipoledipole interactions → hydrogen bonds 

London Forces
Formation: 
1) Electrons in atoms/molecules are constantly moving. 
2) At any instant, the distribution may not be symmetrical. This results in a temporary(instantaneous) dipole. 
3) The dipole induces dipoles in close neighbouring atoms/molecules and leads to an attraction between the atoms/molecules. 
4) These attractions between molecules are called London forces.

The more electrons an atom/molecule has, the greater the dipole formed and the stronger the London forces that arise. Therefore more energy is required to break them and the melting/boiling point of the substance is higher. 

Permanent dipole-dipole forces:
- Occurs between polar molecules.
- Stronger than London forces but weaker than hydrogen bonds.
- Represented with a labelled dashed line. 

The larger the dipole formed, the stronger the permanent dipole-dipole interactions that arise. Therefore more energy is required to break them and the melting/boiling point of the substance is higher. 

Hydrogen Bonding:
Definition - A strong permanent dipole attraction between a δ+ hydrogen on one molecule and a lone pair on a δ− oxygen, fluorine or nitrogen on a different molecule. 
Drawing Rules: 
- Hydrogen bonds are shown as a labelled series of dashes between the lone pair and the hydrogen. 
- The lone pair on the O/N/F must be shown.
- Partial charges must be shown.
- The two bonds/hydrogen bonds either side of the H must be in a straight line. 


- All molecules have London forces.
- Polar molecules also have permanent dipole-dipole interactions and/or hydrogen bonds.
- London forces and permanent dipole-dipole interactions are both types of Van der Waals forces. 

Stronger IMFs → more energy required to break bonds → higher mp/bp 

Boiling Point:  
- In order to boil a simple molecular structure, the forces of attraction within the structure must be broken, leaving behind separated molecules. 
- The energy required to
