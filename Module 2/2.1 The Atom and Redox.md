## 2.1.1 Atoms, Ions and Isotopes
[[Module 2|Definitions]]  
- The nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons.
- Electrons exist in shells outside the nucleus, and most of an atom is empty space. 
- Different elements contain different numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons, and can be identified by their nuclear symbol (e.g. He for Helium).

Mass Spectrometry (does not need to be learned)
1) Gaseous particles are injected into the spectrometer and hit with a high energy beam of electrons. ($X_{g}\rightarrow e^{-}+X_{g}^{+}$)
2) The ions are accelerated by an electrical field.
3) The ions hit the detector, lowest mass first and highest mass last.
4) The detector is connected to a computer and the data is processed. The data produced appears in the form of a graph called a mass spectrum.

$\frac{(abundance_{1}\times mass_{1})+(abundance_{2}\times mass_{2})+...}{total\ abundance (100)}=$Ar in gmol$^{-1}$

## 2.1.3 Ionisation Energy
[[Module 2#2 1 3 Ionisation Energy|Definitions]]  
- Elements can have as many ionisation energies as they have electrons. 
- They always involve removing one electron from one mole of items in the gaseous state, increasing their charge by 1$^+$. 
- It always takes more energy to remove the next electron → successive ionisation energies always increase.
-  Ionisation energy is directly related to nuclear attraction.[^1]
-  The greater the nuclear attraction, the greater the first ionisation energy.
-  There is a big jump when an electron is removed from a different shell.

Factors that affect nuclear attraction: 
- Atomic radius → As the atomic radius increases, nuclear attraction decreases.
- Shielding (Number of inner shells) → As the number of inner shells increases, shielding increases. As shielding increases, the nuclear attraction decreases. 
- Nuclear charge (No of protons in nucleus) → Nuclear charge increases nuclear attraction. In short, atomic radius and shielding are inversely proportional to nuclear attraction and nuclear charge is directly proportional.

Trends: 
- Across a period, first ionisation energy is mostly affected by nuclear charge and atomic radius changes; shielding remains almost the same across the period. 
- Down a group, there is a large increase in atomic radius as you move down each successive member of the group; first ionisation energy is therefore more affected by atomic radius and shielding despite the increase in nuclear charge.

## 2.1.4 Atomic Structure
[[Module 2#2 1 4 Atomic Structure|Definitions]]
![[atomic structure.jpg|300]] 
Each atom is made of shells which are made of subshells. Subshells are made up of orbitals. 

Orbitals:
- They are regions which can hold up to two electrons with opposite spins.
- There are 4 different types of orbital: s(spherical), p(dumbbell), d and f. 
- Orbitals are represented as boxes and the electrons are represented as arrows. 

Subshells: 
- Made of orbitals. 
- s subshells are made of a single s orbital. They can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. 
- p subshells are made of 3 p orbitals. They can hold a maximum of 6 electrons. 
- d subshells are made of 5 d orbitals. They can hold a maximum of 10 electrons. 

Shells: 
- Shells are made of subshells.
- The number of a shell (n) is known as its principal quantum number. Electrons in high shells/subshells have higher energy. 
- Within a given shell, energy level always increases. 

Hund’s Law: When filling a subshell, a single electron must be present in every orbital before a second electron is added to any orbital. 
1s → 2s → 2p → 3s → 3p → 4s → 3d in order of energy from lowest to highest.

## 2.1.5 Oxidation Number/State Rules
1) Every atom in a species has its own oxidation number, these are almost always the same for each atom of the same element. They are written with the +/- sign before the number. 
2) Uncombined elements have an oxidation number of 0. 
3) In neutral compounds, the sum of the oxidation numbers is 0. 
4) In ions, the sum of the oxidation numbers equals the charge of the ion. 
    a) Elements in simple ions have the same oxidation number as the charge on the ion. 
	b) In a polyatomic ion, the oxidation numbers must all add up to the charge on the ion.
5) The oxidation number of combined fluorine is always -1.
6) The oxidation number of a combined group 1 metal is always +1. 
7) The oxidation number of combined hydrogen is always +1. 
8) The oxidation number of combined oxygen is always -2. 

Exceptions: 
- In metal hydrides, H has an oxidation number of -1.
- In hydrogen peroxide, O has an oxidation number of -1. 

Naming using Roman Numerals: 
- Roman numerals indicate a positive oxidation number.
- When written after metal cations, they show the oxidation number of the metal. This is done for metals that can form more than one stable ion.
- When written after polyatomic anions, they show the oxidation number of the element in the ion which isn’t oxygen. 

Reducing and Oxidising agents: 
- The species responsible for oxidising another is called the oxidising agent. It contains the element that is reduced.
- The species responsible for reducing another is called the reducing agent. It contains the element that is oxidised.
