## 4.2.1 Structure of Alkenes 
[[Module 4#4 2 1 Structure of Alkenes|Definitions]]    
Sigma Bonds:
- Bonds are formed when orbitals on two different atoms overlap.
- Sigma (σ) bonds are formed from a direct overlap of orbitals.
- Single bonds are always σ bonds.
-  Electrons are found between atomic nuclei. 

Pi Bonds: 
![[pi bond.png|350]]    
- π bonds are formed when p/d orbitals of two atoms overlap sideways, producing a 2nd or 3rd bond between the atoms. 
- π bonds are always formed as part of double or triple bonds. 
- π bonds are weaker than σ bonds, and thus break more easily.
- Electrons are found above and below the plane of atoms. 

Bond Rotation: 
- In alkenes, the C-C bonds are free to rotate. 
- The p orbitals must be parallel so they can overlap for the C=C bond. If the bond was rotated, the orbitals would no longer overlap and the the π bond would break. As this would take a lot of energy, it cannot happen. Therefore the C=C bond has a restricted rotation.

- Alkenes have a trigonal planar shape around each carbon atom of the double bond. 

E/Z Isomerism: 
- The restricted rotation around the C=C bond can cause the molecule to have two different isomers, provided that each carbon in the C=C bond is attached to two different groups. 
- E/Z isomerism is an example of stereoisomerism. 
- E/Z labels are assigned with the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. These rules assign a priority order to the groups attached to a carbon atom. 
- Depending on how the higher priority groups are arranged relative to each other, the molecule is assigned as E or Z. 
- Z=Priority groups are on the same side, E= Priority groups are on opposite sides.

Trans/Cis Isomerism: 
When one (or two) particular group(s) appears on each C in the C=C, the molecule can also be named as cis or trans. 
- In cis isomers, the matching groups are on the same side of the imaginary line along the double bond. 
- In trans isomers, the matching groups are on the opposite sides of this line. 
- Alkene stereoisomers can always be labelled as E or Z, but many cannot be named cis or trans - cis/trans isomerism is a subset of E/Z isomerism. 
![[cis trans isomerism.png]]    

CIP Rules: 
1) Look at each C in the C=C bond once at a time. 
2) List the atoms directly attached to the C in C=C. Larger atomic number means higher priority. 
3) If the two atoms are the same, list the atomic numbers of the atoms that are one bond out from the C=C from largest to smallest. Compare the numbers one by one. The first group to contain a higher number is the priority group. 
4) Draw an imaginary line along the C=C bond. If both priority groups are on the same side of the line, it is the Z isomer. If they are on opposite sides, it is the E isomer.

## 4.2.2 Reactions of Alkenes 
[[Module 4#4 2 2 Reactions of Alkenes|Definitions]]    
- Alkenes undergo electrophilic addition reactions. 
- The two new groups of atoms always attach to the carbons that were in the double bond. 
- Different addition reactions have different reagents, conditions and products.
- Reactions between unsymmetrical alkenes and unsymmetrical reactants create multiple products. 

Testing for Alkenes: 
- Chemical tests are simple test tube reactions, the observations of which can be used to identify if a molecule contains specific functional groups.
- The reaction between bromine water and alkenes can be used as a chemical test for the alkene functional group.
- Bromine water is an orange solution. It decolourises when it reacts with an alkene.
- Two layers are likely to form, as water is polar and alkene solutions tend to be non-polar. 

Electrophilic Addition: ^8f0f3a
- In this reaction, the small molecule acts as an electrophile. 
- The electron rich centre is the double bond in the alkene. 
- The C=C bond becomes saturated, and therefore the reaction is described as an addition reaction. 

Chemical Mechanism: 
- Curly arrows in red are used to show the movement of pairs of electrons into/out of bonds and lone pairs. 
1) The double bond in the alkene is electron-rich and attracts electrophiles. 
2) The π bond in the C=C bond breaks. The pair of electrons from the π bond make a new bond to the δ+ atom in the electrophile. 
3) The δ+ atom now has too many bonds. The polar bond in the electrophile breaks and the electrons move onto the δ− atom as a lone pair. 
4) The bond is broken by [[Module 4#^e521c1|heterolytic fission]]    , forming two ions. The organic ion is known as a carbocation.  
5) A bond forms from the lone pair on the negative ion to the positive carbocation, forming the product. 
![[carbocationmeme.png|250]]    

- The electrophile should be drawn vertically, with the δ+ end nearest the C=C 
- Both partial and full charges must be shown.
- Curly arrows must be precise, starting from a bond or lone pair and going clearly towards an atom.
- Two products can be formed if both the reactants are unsymmetrical.

Unsymmetrical Addition: 
Unsymmetrical alkene + unsymmetrical reactant → mixture of Z products 
- The mixture of products contains different amounts of each product.
- The product in larger quantity is known as the major product.
- The product in smaller quantity is known as the minor product. 
- The more positive (δ+) end of the reactant molecule will preferentially join to the carbon (in C=C) with fewer carbon atoms attached and the more negative (δ−) end will join onto the carbon with more carbon atoms attached. (Markovnikov’s Rule) 

- The proportion of products can be predicted because the two carbocations formed have different stabilities.
- The more stable carbocation is the one where the + charge has more carbon atoms attached. The negative (δ− atom in the reactant) will attach to the carbon atom which has the + charge. 

Carbocation classification:
As part of the electrophilic addition mechanism, a carbocation intermediate is formed. Carbocations can be classed as being primary, secondary or tertiary. 
- Primary - Positive charge is on a carbon attached to one alkyl group. 
- Secondary - Positive charge is on a carbon attached to two alkyl groups. 
- Tertiary - Positive charge is on a carbon attached to three alkyl groups. 

From least stable to most stable: primary→secondary→tertiary

- The product that forms from the most stable carbocation will form the major product.

[[Module 4#^3224c5|Addition Polymerisation]]    :
- Polymer sections always need to be shown with the carbons bonded horizontally and other atoms bonded vertically.
-  Polymers are named poly(alkene), e.g. poly(ethene). 
-  The section repeated in a polymer is known as the repeat unit.

## 4.2.3 Disposal of Plastics
- Can be burned as a fuel to produce energy (as long as the products are not toxic) 
- Can be put in landfill
- Can be broken down into monomers and used as a fuelstock for organic reactions.
- PVC can be dissolved and recycled but cannot be used as fuel because it produces HCl gas when burned. 

Alternatives to plastics: 
- Photodegradable plastics
- Biodegradable plastics 

## 4.2.4 Percentage Yield and Atom Economy
[[Module 4#4 2 4 Percentage Yield and Atom Economy|Definitions]]    
Percentage Yield:
- The proportion of reactants converted into intended product
Percentage Yield $=\frac{actual\ mass\ of\ product}{theoretical\ mass\ of\ product}\times 100$

Atom Economy:
- How much material is wasted
Atom Economy $=\frac{Mr\ of\ useful\ product}{Mr\ of\ all\ reactants}\times 100$
