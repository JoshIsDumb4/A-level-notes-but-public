## 4.3.1 Introduction
- Haloalkanes contain group 7 (halogen) atoms.
- Named like branches, with the prefixes fluoro, chloro, iodo, etc.
`Note: OH group takes priority over the halogen when naming.`
- They can be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary depending on where the halogen is on the carbon chain.

Primary haloalkane - Halogen is attached to 2 hydrogen atoms. 
Secondary haloalkane - Halogen is attached to 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen atom. 
Tertiary haloalkane - Halogen is attached to no hydrogen atom.

Haloalkanes can be made in 3 ways:
1. From alkanes in radical substitution reactions. 
2. From alkenes in electrophilic addition reactions.
3. From alcohols/amines in nucleophilic addition reactions.

## 4.3.2 Reactions of Haloalkanes
- Haloalkanes react in substitution reactions to make alcohol and amines. The reaction to produce alcohols generally involves adding aqueous alkalis, e.g. $\ce{CH3CH2Cl + NaOH → CH3CH2OH + NaCl}$ 
- This reaction needs to be heated in order to proceed, and this is often for a long period of time.
- To avoid losing all the liquid as vapour, it must be heated under reflux.

- Hydrolysis of haloalkanes is used for synthesising products or as a chemical test (identifying functional group of monitoring rate of reaction).
- The reagents and conditions of a reaction are often altered depending on its purpose. 

Synthesis: 
- Heat under reflux → reflux provides the energy needed for the reaction without letting volatile reactants/products escape, ensuring yield is as high as possible. 
- Sodium/potassium hydroxide to provide $\ce{OH−}$ ions.

Chemical Tests: 
- Aqueous silver nitrate → water is used as a reactant to create hydroxide ions, silver reacts with halides. This shows rate of reaction.
- Ethanol → solvent (polar OH group allows it to dissolve water and ions, non-polar alkyl regions allow it to dissolve the haloalkane)
- Hot water bath → provides energy (not flame because ethanol is flammable) 

Factors that can determine the rate of hydrolysis: 
- The strength of the δ + on the C → nucleophilic attraction. 
- The bond enthalpy. → The bond enthalpies of the C-Halogen bond determine the speed of the hydrolysis reaction; the weaker the bond, the easier it is to break, so the faster it hydrolyses.

## 4.3.3 Ozone
Ozone ($\ce{O3}$) protects the surface of the earth by absorbing harmful high energy UV radiation. 
1) Ozone is formed by oxygen in the lower stratosphere: $\ce{O2 + hv → 2O·}$ then $\ce{O · + O2 → O3}$ 
2) Ozone absorbs high energy UV: $\ce{O3 + hv → O2 + O·}$
3) Some ozone is also reacted away: $\ce{O3 + O· → 2O2}$


Left undisturbed, this cycle continues, maintaining a roughly fixed amount of ozone in the atmosphere.

CFCs:
Chlorofluorocarbons are molecules that consist of only chlorine, fluorine and carbon. The sun emits UV radiation. The radiation that reaches the troposphere is not of high enough energy to break C-Cl or C-F bonds. This is because the high energy UV has been absorbed by ozone.

The UV radiation reaching the stratosphere is of higher energy, enough to break C-Cl bonds to create $Cl·$. Chlorine radicals pose a significant hazard because they catalyse the breakdown of ozone. Each chlorine radical produced is capable of catalysing the breakdown of 100,000 ozone molecules. This leads to an imbalance between the rate of ozone formation and the rate of ozone depletion, leaving holes in the ozone layer in some areas. To avoid this, HCFCs are used instead. The C-H bond is weak enough to break before the molecules reach the stratosphere.
