## 4.5.1 Infrared Spectroscopy
Bonds and Infrared Radiation: 
- Covalent bonds naturally vibrate.
- Different types of bond can absorb different frequencies of infrared radiation, causing them to vibrate more.
- By looking at the frequencies of infrared radiation that a molecule absorbs, you can work out the types of bonds it contains.

Infrared radiation → Sample (absorbs some frequencies) → Detector 

Infrared Spectrum Graph:
- Y axis is transmittance percentage, x axis is wavenumber ($\pu{cm−1}$), which is used to define the energy of the radiation absorbed. 
- Peaks occur where specific types of bonds absorb specific frequencies of radiation.
- The region right of 1800$\pu{cm−1}$ is known as the fingerprint region.
-  Individual peaks are not normally identified in this region and instead, the overall shape is compared to a database.
-  The OH peak of an alcohol is normally symmetrical and finishes before 3000.
-  The OH peak of a carboxylic acid is generally broad and messy.

## 4.5.2 Greenhouse Effect
1) Sunlight hits the Earth and some light is re-emitted as infrared radiation. 
2)  Some molecules (e.g. $\ce{H2O, CO2, CH4}$) absorb the radiation in the atmosphere so that it isn’t emitted to space. 
3)  The extra energy absorbed by these molecules is passed on to the other molecules in the atmosphere during collisions, and so the whole atmosphere warms up.

- Greenhouse effect is the reason why the Earth is warm enough for life.
- Amount of carbon dioxide has been increasing since the industrial revolution, disrupting the temperature equilibrium and causing climate change.

Effects of Climate Change: 
- Rising sea levels. 
- Loss of biodiversity.

## 4.5.3 Mass Spectrometry
When you put a gaseous sample of atoms of an element in a mass spectrometer, they are ionised using a high energy beam of electrons, e.g. $\ce{Br_{(g)} + e− → [Br]^+_{(g)} + 2e−}$. The ions then move through the mass spectrometer, are analysed and produce peaks on the mass spectrum. 

When a gaseous sample of molecules is used, two things may happen: 
1) The whole molecule is ionised, forming a molecular ion, e.g. $\ce{M_{(g)} + e− → [M]^+_{(g)} + 2e−}$ 
2) The molecular ion fragments, forming a charged fragment and an uncharged fragment: $\ce{M^+_{(g)} → [A+]_{(g)} + B_{(g)}}$ 

- Only ions move around the mass spectrometer, are analysed and produced peaks on the mass spectrum.

Fragmentation: 
- When a molecular ion is formed, the removal of an electron is likely to weaken the bond it was taken from, thus making it liable to break.
- If a bond breaks, 2 fragments are produced: one with a positive charge and one neutral radical.
- Further fragmentation may occur, which can make the spectrum look complicated

Mass Spectrometry Graph: 
- m/z value = Mr 
- The molecular ion peak is always the one furthest to the right (highest m/z) and tells you the Mr.
- Sometimes there is a smaller peak one unit higher than the M$^+$ peak due to a carbon-13 isotope (M$^{+1}$). This peak can be ignored. 
- M$^{+1}$ is always odd, M$^+$ is always even.
- All peaks in a mass spectrum will always be due to a positive ion. 
- It will never be possible to assign every peak, so stick to the tall ones.
- C-C bonds either side of a C=O group are more liable to breaks. 
- Fragments can only ever be suggested, nothing is certain.
