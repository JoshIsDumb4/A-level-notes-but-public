- Alcohols are classified similarly to carbocations, with primary, secondary and tertiary. 

Primary - OH group is attached to a carbon that is attached to two hydrogen atoms.  
Secondary - OH group is attached to a carbon that is attached to one hydrogen atom (+ 1 carbon). 
Tertiary - OH group is attached to a carbon that is attached to no hydrogen atoms (is attached to two carbons). 

## 4.4.1 Combustion Reactions
Complete: $\ce{C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O}$  
Incomplete: $\ce{C2H5OH + 2O2 → 2CO + 3H2O}$ 
- Use structural formula. 
- Incomplete combustion can contain any mixture of $\ce{CO, C}$ and $\ce{CO2}$. 
- Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic and soot (C) can cause respiratory issues.

## 4.4.2 Elimination (Dehydration) Reactions
Conditions - Acid catalyst (H2SO4) and heated under reflux. 
alcohol → alkene + water 
- The C=C bond formed will always include the carbon that the alcohol group was attached to.
- Depending on the position of the alcohol group, more than one product can be formed (E/Z isomers).

## 4.4.3 Substitution Reactions
- Alcohols can be converted to haloalkanes by nucleophilic substitution.
$\ce{Alcohol + Na_X + H2SO4 → haloalkane + NaHSO4 + H2O}$ 

In this reaction, the sodium halide and sulfuric acid react together to produce a hydrogen halide in situ. The hydrogen halide then reacts with the alcohol to form a haloalkane. 
1.  $\ce{Na_X + H2SO4 → HX + NaHSO4}$ 
2.  $\ce{HX + alcohol → H2O + haloalkane}$

## 4.4.4 Oxidation
- Alcohols can be oxidised to form new functional groups.
- Depending on whether the alcohol is primary, secondary or tertiary, different products will be formed. 
- The oxidising agent is always acidified potassium dichromate ($\ce{H2CrO7}$), an orange solution. 
- The chromium is released during the reaction, forming green $\ce{Cr3+}$ ions and sometimes blue $\ce{Cr2+}$ ions. 
- The oxidising agent can be represented as [O] in an equation. 

Primary Alcohols:
Primary Alcohol → Aldehyde → Carboxylic Acid 
- Mild oxidation forms an aldehyde. It must be immediately distilled to prevent the aldehyde from oxidising further to create a carboxylic acid.
- Strong oxidation produces a carboxylic acid. This reaction must be done under reflux. 

Secondary Alcohols: 
Secondary Alcohol → Ketone 
- Must be heated under reflux. 

Tertiary alcohols do not oxidise.

## 4.4.5 Esterification

Alcohol + Carboxlic acid → Ester + Water 
Conditions: Concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$ catalyst, reflux 
- Esters often have a smell and are therefore used in perfumes. 
- A benzene ring as a side chain is called phenyl. 
- A benzene ring on the C=O side is called benzoate. 
- Alcohol is given suffix ”yl” and the carboxylic acid is given the suffix ”oate”, e.g. methanol + ethanoic acid → methyl ethanoate + water.
