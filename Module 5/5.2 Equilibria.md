## 5.2.1 Le Chatelier's Principle
[[Module 5#5 2 Equilibria|Definitions]]
_When a system in dynamic equilibrium is subjected to a change, the reaction will shift to minimise the change._

| Change                    | How the position of equilibrium shifts                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Increase in temperature   | Equilibrium moves in the endothermic direction.                                      |
| Decrease in temperature   | Equilibrium moves in the exothermic direction.                                       |
| Increase in pressure      | Equilibrium shifts in the direction that produces a smaller number of gas molecules. |
| Decrease in pressure      | Equilibrium shifts in the direction that produces more gas molecules.                |
| Increase in concentration | Equilibrium shifts to the right to create more product.                              |
| Decrease in concentration | Equilibrium shifts to the left to create more reactant.                              |

- Pressure only affects the position of equilibrium when there are gases in the equation
- Catalysts speed up the forwards and the backwards reaction, so equilibrium is reached faster. They do not affect the position of equilibrium.

When a dynamic equilibrium has been established:
- It is a closed system
- The rate of the forwards reaction equals the rate of the backwards reaction
- The amounts of product and reactant appear to stay the same

## 5.2.2 The Equilibrium Constant (Kc)
An exact mathematical position of equilibrium (Kc) for any reaction at equilibrium can be calculated using the equilibrium law.

```ad-info
title: The Equilibrium Law
For the reaction aA + bB $\ce{<=>}$ cC + dD
$K_{c}=\frac{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}$
```

- The magnitude of Kc indicates the position of equilibrium: $K_c<1$ indicates that the position of equilibrium is to the left and $K_{c}>1$ indicates that the position of equilibrium is to the right. 
- Only gases and aqueous solutions are included in Kc (species which can have a concentration)
- The value of Kc depends **only** on temperature

## 5.2.3 Kp
$K_p$ is used for gaseous equilibria when the partial pressure of the gases in the system is known. The equation only contains gases. 

```ad-info
title: $K_{p}$ equation
For the reaction aA(g) + bB(g) $\ce{<=>}$ cC(g) + dD(g)
$K_{p}=\frac{p(C)^{c}p(D)^{d}}{p(A)^{a}p(B)^{b}}$
```

mole fraction = $\frac{\text{moles}}{\text{total moles in mixture}}$  
partial pressure = mole fraction $\times$ total pressure

## 5.2.4 ICE Equations
To calculate $K_{c}$ or $K_{p}$, an additional step is required when the following data is given:
- The initial moles/concentration of all substances
- The moles/concentration of all substances at equilibrium

Example: $\ce{CH4(g) + H2O (g) <=> CO2 (g) + 3H2(g)}$

|                   | $CH_{4}$ | $H_{2}O$ | $CO_{2}$ | $3H_{2}$ |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Initial Moles     | 1        | 1        | 0        | 0        |
| Change in Moles   | -0.4     | -0.4     | +0.4     | +1.2     |
| Equilibrium Moles | 0.6      | 0.6      | 0.4      | 1.2      |
Then the concentrations at equilibrium can be substituted into the $K_{c}$ or $K_{p}$ equation.

## 5.2.5 Industry - The Haber Process
$\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=> 2NH3(g)}$ and $\Delta H=-92\pu{kJmol-1}$
- In industry, compromises between efficiency, cost, safety and other factors must be made. 

Conditions:
- 400-500c
- 200atm
- Iron catalyst
