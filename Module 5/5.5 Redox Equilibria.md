## 5.5.1 Half Equations
Half equations show what is happening to an individual element in a chemical reaction in terms of loss/gain of electrons. They must balance in terms of matter and charge.

Acidic Conditions:
- $\ce{H+, H2O} \text{ and } \ce{e-}$ are used to balance things.
e.g. $\ce{5e- + 8H+ + MnO4- -> Mn^2+ + 4H2O}$

Alkaline Conditions:
- $\ce{OH-, H2O} \text{ and } \ce{e-}$ are used to balance things.
e.g. $\ce{5e- + 4H2O + + MnO4- -> Mn^2+ + 8OH-}$

### Combining/Subtracting Half Equations
Half equations can be added together just like polynomials. The number of electrons on both sides must balance. Anything that appears on both sides of the equation cancel out.

### Balancing Redox Equations
1. Assign oxidation numbers to every element in the ionic equation
2. Identify redox
3. Balance total increase and decrease of electrons
4. Balance rest of equation

## 5.5.2 Redox Titrations
- Used to measure the moles of transition metal ions in a solution.

Manganate(VII) titration - used to find the concentration of reducing agents
Iodine/Thiosulfate titration - used to find the concentration of oxidising agents
```
### Manganate(VII) Titration
$\color{purple}\ce{MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e-} \color{white}\rightarrow \ce{Mn^2+ + 4H2O}$
- The reaction is self indicating (colourless to pink), and must be done in acidic conditions. 

Method:
- Burette is filled with a solution of manganate(VII) ions
- Test solution is added to a conical flask, then **dilute** $\ce{H2SO4}$ is added.

### Iodine/Sodium Thiosulphate Titration
$\ce{2S2O3^2- + I2 -> S4O6^2- + 2I-}$
Similar method to manganate titration. 
- Starch can be added to help determine the end-point. Starch is blue/black in the presence of iodine.

## 5.5.3 Electrochemical Cells
Position of equilibrium is left -> metal has a negative charge, electrode has negative potential.
Position of equilibrium is right -> metal has a positive charge, electrode has positive potential.

- POE depends on the metal
- Reactive metals tend to have negative potentials and unreactive metals tend to have positive potentials.

## 5.5.4 Standard Electrode Potentials and Cell Potentials
### Feasibility
A reaction is described as feasible if it is energetically possible for it to happen. In a feasible redox reaction, the half reaction for the oxidising agent must have a more positive standard redox potential than the half reaction for the reducing agent.

### Non-standard Conditions
- Predictions based on E$^\theta$ are only valid under standard conditions
- Non-standard conditions cause the poe to shift, resulting in E$^{\theta}$ and Ecell to change.

## 5.5.5 Batteries and Fuel Cells
Primary - Non-rechargeable cells
Secondary - Rechargeable cells (Li-ion)

### Fuel Cells
- Active materials are not an integral part of the device
- Requires active materials to be fed into the batteries from an outside source
