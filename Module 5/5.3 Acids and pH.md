## 5.3.1 Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
Basicity:
- Monoprotic acids donate a single proton.
- Diprotic acids donate two protons. Each donation could be strong or weak, but the donations always get weaker as more protons are lost.

Conjugate acids - Species that release protons to form a conjugate base.
Conjugate bases - Species that gain protons to form a conjugate acid.

## 5.3.2 pH Calculations for Acids
### Strong Acids
```ad-info
title: Calculating pH
$pH=-\log[H^+]$
```
pH is a negative logarithmic scale $\rightarrow$ every time the pH changes by 1, the number of hydrogen ions in solution change by a factor of 10.

### Weak Acids
For an acid with the equation $\ce{HA <=> H+ + A-}$ :
$Ka=\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$ and $pKa=-\log[Ka]$  

It can then be assumed that $[H^+]=[A^-]$ and thus the expression for Ka becomes $Ka=\frac{[H^+]^{2}}{[HA]}$. From there, it is possible to solve for $[H^+]$ and pH. 

Ka is a measure of acid strength - the stronger an acid is, the more it dissociates. This causes the numerator to increase and the denominator to decrease, so the larger the Ka, the stronger the acid.The smaller the pKa, the stronger the acid.

## 5.3.3 pH Calculations for Bases
Kw is the ionic product of water:
$\ce{H2O(l) <=> H+ + OH-} \rightarrow Kw=[H^+][OH^-]$  
$Kw=1\times10^{-14}\pu{mol2dm-6}$ at rtp, so $pKw=14$

## 5.3.4 Buffer Solutions
Definition - Solutions that resist changes in pH upon small additions of acid/alkali.

- Acidic buffers are made from weak acids mixed with their conjugate bases.
- Alkaline buffers are made from weak bases mixed with their conjugate acids.

Making Buffers:
The equilibrium setup in a buffer is similar to that of a weak acid: $\ce{HA <=> H+ + A-}$. There are large reservoirs of both the HA and A$^-$ present, only the H$^+$ concentration is low. The position of equilibrium lies centrally. 

There are 3 possible ways to make a buffer:
1. Mix a solution of HA with a solution containing A$^-$ ions.
2. Dissolve some solid containing A$^-$ ions in a solution of HA.
3. React an excess of a solution of HA with a strong base.

Choosing a Buffer:
- Ideally, an acid with a pKa value as close to the desired pH of the buffer solution should be chosen.
- To lower the pH of the buffer, more HA than A$^-$ should be added and vice versa for increasing the pH.

```ad-info
title: Equation for Calculating the pH of a buffer solution
pH=pKa-log$\frac{[HA]}{[A^-]}$
```

## 5.3.5 Titration Curves
![[pH curve.png|500]]
- All pH curves have the same basic shape, but vary depending on the strength of the acid/base used.
- The stronger the acid/base, the steeper the equivalence point is.

Equivalence point - Where [acid]=[alkali]. The pH changes rapidly at this point. 
End point - The point in the titration at which there are equal concentrations of the wek acid and conjugate base forms of the indicator.

Indicators:
- Acid-base indicators are weak acids - $\ce{HIn <=> H+ + In-}$
- The end point of a titration is determined by the indicator chosen.
- The pH at the end point is roughly the pKa of the indicator. Therefore when choosing an indicator, the pH of the equivalence point and the pH at the end point (pKa of the indicator) need to match.
