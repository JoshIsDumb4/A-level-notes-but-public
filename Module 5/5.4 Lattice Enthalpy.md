## 5.4.1 Born-Haber Cycles
- The magnitude of the lattice enthalpy is a measure of the strength of the ionic bonding.
- Lattice enthalpy becomes more exothermic as the strength of ionic bonding increases.
- Stronger attractions form between smaller ions and higher charged ions.

**Born-Haber Cycles cannot be used for compounds that contain polyatomic ions.**

### Factors affecting $\Delta_{LE}H^{\theta}$
The greater the charge density of the ions involved, the greater the forces of electrostatic attraction between the ions. Therefore $\Delta_{LE}H^{\theta}$ is more exothermic.

### Factors affecting $\Delta_{hyd}H^{\theta}$
The greater the charge density of the ions involved, the greater the forces of electrostatic attraction between the ions and the water molecules. Therefore $\Delta_{hyd}H^{\theta}$ is more exothermic.

## 5.4.2 Entropy
Entropy - The quantative measure of the degree of disorder of a system. The higher the entropy, the more disordered the system.
Entropy in the universe always increases. If entropy in a system falls, something else in the universe has an increase in entropy.

$\Delta S$ $(\pu{JK-1mol-1})=\Sigma (S^{\theta}_{products}-S^{\theta}_{reactants})$

## 5.4.3 Gibbs Free Energy
Feasible reaction - a reaction that occurs without a continuous supply of energy.
Gibbs free energy is used to quantitively decide if a reaction is feasible. If a reaction is theoretically feasible but doesn't appear to happen, the rate of reaction might be really slow.

```ad-info
title: Calculating Gibbs Free Energy
$\Delta G\ (\pu{kJmol-1}) = \Delta H\ (\pu{kJmol-1}) - \Delta S(\pu{kJmol-1})T(K)$

Note that $\Delta S$ must be converted to $\pu{kJmol-1}$
_If $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is feasible._
