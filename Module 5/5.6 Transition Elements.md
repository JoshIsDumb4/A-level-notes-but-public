Transition Element - A d-block element that forms at least one ion with an incomplete d sub-shell.
```
## 5.6.1 Properties
- Form compounds in which the transition metal has variable oxidation states
- Compounds form coloured solutions when dissolved in water
- Metals catalyse chemical reactions
- Elements from titanium to copper form ions with two or more oxidation states

### Variable Oxidation States
- Arises from the similar energies required for the removal of 4s and 3d electrons
- All (except Sc) form a 2+ ion. The stability of the +2 state increases across the row due to increase in 3rd IE.
- Electrons are removed from 4s first
- Highest oxidation state is often a strong oxidising agent
- Elements often require little energy to switch oxidation state

### Coloured Ions
- Ions with a d10 or d0 config are colourless
- Ions with partially filled d orbitals tend to be coloured

title: Why ions with partially filled d orbitals are coloured:
This is because of the ease of transition of electrons between energy levels. Energy is absorbed when an electron is promoted to a higher level. The frequency of light is proportional to the energy difference.
```
### Transition Metals as Catalysts
- They provide a surface on which the reaction can take place. Reactants are **adsorbed** onto the surface and held in place whilst the reaction occurs.
- Transition metal ions can form intermediates as part of a chemical pathway.

## 5.6.2 Complex Ions
Complex Ion - A transition metal ion bonded to one or more ligands by dative covalent bonds (coordinate bonds).
Ligand - A molecule or ion that can donate a pair of electrons to a transition metal ion to form a coordinate bond.
Coordination Number - The total number of coordinate bonds formed between a central metal ion and its ligands.
(Dative covalent bonds are called coordinate bonds when talking about complex ions)

Cis - A pair of like ligands are next to each other
Trans - A pair of like ligands are opposite each other

Denticity:
Individual ions can form more than one bond to the central ion.

| Type        | No of bonds |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Monodentate | 1           |
| Bidentate   | 2           |
| Polydentate | >2          |

### Ligand Substitution
- Occurs when a solution of one ligand is added to a solution of a metal complex with another ligand
- Reaction is reversible
- Shape and colour of the complex ion often changes as part of the reaction. This can happen because the incoming ligand forms a stronger coordinate bond/there is a higher concentration of the incoming ligand, changing the poe.
