## 5.1.1 The Rate Equation
The rate equation is used to describe the mathematical relationship between concentration of each reactant and the rate of a reaction.
```ad-info
title: The Rate Equation
For the reaction A + B → products, rate =$k[A]^m[B]^n$
```

Where k=rate constant, m=order of reaction with respect to A, n=order of reaction with respect to B, [A] is the concentration of reactant A, [B] is the concentration of reactant B.
m+n=overall order
- Only substances which can have different concentration are found in the rate equation (no water, no solids).

Order 0:
Rate is unaffected by changes in the concentration.
Rate = [A]$^0$ = 1

Order 1:
Rate is directly proportional to concentration.
rate ∝ concentration
Rate = [A]$^1$

Order 2:
Rate is directly proportional to concentration$^2$
rate ∝ concentration$^2$
Rate = [A]$^2$

## 5.1.2 Order from Initial Rates
- The rate equation can be deduced from the initial rates of reaction.
- Initial rates are used because the concentrations of the reactants are known.
- Initial rates are shown in a table, which can then be used to work out the order with respect to
each reagent and the value of the rate constant.
- Orders can be derived directly from data by comparing two experiments where the concentration of
one of the reactants has been changed.
- The relationship between concentration and rate determines order.

Monitoring the Rate:
Rate of Reaction - The change in concentration of a reactant (or product) in a given time.
Rate = $\frac{\Delta concentration}{\Delta time}$ $(\pu{moldm-3s-1})$ 

In order to determine the rate of reaction, the concentration of a reactant/product must be measured at regular time intervals. However, this is nigh on impossible during a reaction. Therefore a proxy is used. These proxies can be things such as mass, volume of gas produced, colour, conductivity, etc (as long as they are easily measurable).

[[3.3 Rates of Reaction#3 3 2 Measuring the Rate of Reaction|Measuring the Rate of Reaction]]

Continuous Monitoring:
- Follow a given reaction mixture by measuring a particular quantity over time. 
- Plot graph of [reactant] or [product] vs time.

Clock Reactions:
- Set up a reaction mixture and measure the time taken for a specific change to occur (often a colour change).
- Only one measurement per reaction mixture.
- Sometimes it is not possible to use a feature of the reaction itself to provide the timing point, so a fixed and known quantity of an extra chemical is added to the reaction mixture to react with the product.
- Clock reactions measure the average rate at the start of the reaction, NOT initial rate.
- The accuracy of using a clock reaction to find the initial rate of reaction depends on how soon the timing point is to the start of the reaction.

## 5.1.3 Finding Order using Graphical Methods
Drawing Tangents:
The gradient of a tangent on a concentration time graph is equal to the rate of reaction.
1.  Mark at least 3 tangents clearly on a graph at concentration C, C/2 and C/4.
2.   Work out the gradient for each.
3.   Work out the relationship between rate and concentration.

Half-Life:
Definition - The time taken for the amount of reactant to decrease by $\frac{1}{2}$.

If a [reactant] vs time graph has a constant half-life, the reactant is first order. Due to experimental error, the half-life probably won’t be exactly the same.

1.  Mark at least 3 half-lives clearly on a graph.
2.   State the length of each half-life including units.
3.   State that the relationship between the half-lives.
4.   State the order of the process.

For a first order reactant in an order 1 reaction, k =$\frac{ln2}{t_{0.5}}$

## 5.1.4 The Arrhenius Equation
The Arrhenius Equation relates conditions such as temperature and presence of a catalyst to the value
of the rate constant, k.
[[3.3 Rates of Reaction#3 3 3 The Arrhenius Equation]]
It's the exact same as the stuff in module 3.

## 5.1.5 Rate and Mechanism
- The order of reaction with respect to a reactant can be used to obtain information about the reaction [[Module 5#^d92be6|mechanism]].
- Not all the steps take the same amount of time. The slowest step is known as the **rate determining
step**.
- The reaction can only proceed at the rate of the rate determining step (acts as a bottleneck).
- Only the reactants up to and in the rate determining step are included in the rate equation. All other reactants in the mechanism are 0 order because they have no effect on the rate of reaction.
- The coefficients of the reactants in the rate determining step are the orders.
- The orders of the reactants = the moles required for the rate determining step.

To be feasible, a proposed chemical mechanism has to satisfy the following criteria:
1. The mechanism must agree with the chemical equation (contain same moles and types of reactants
and products).
2. The rate determining step must agree with the rate equation (requires the reactants present in the
rate equation and moles=order)
3. Wherever possible, sensible collisions occur.
